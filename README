This is yet another graphic WBFS manager for Linux.

It uses libwbfs from Kwiirk and caristat available at

  http://github.com/kwiirk/wbfs/tree/master


=== WARNINGS ===

This might eat all your partitions. I offer no warranty
whatsoever. Use at your own risk.


=== Requirements ===

To compile the program, you will need to have installed:

  * GTK+
  * Libglade2

=== Compilation ===

To compile the program, enter:

cd path/to/source
make


=== Installation ===

Installation is optional, but if you want to, then simply copy the executable to a directory in your usr path. For example:

sudo cp wbfs_gtk /usr/local/bin

If you choose to install wbfs_gtk, then the command to run it is just:

sudo wbfs_gtk


=== USAGE ===

You must have access to your raw block devices. On most systems, this
means having to run the program as root (or manually changing device
permissions). You may use "sudo"; for example, in Ubuntu you might run
the program as:

  sudo ./wbfs_gtk

When running the program, the first thing you want to do is open your
WBFS partition (or you might want to format one if you don't have it,
see below). In the upper left corner of the screen, select the device
for your USB hard disk or pendrive and click the green arrow beside it
to load it.

(If it shows an error about "bad magic", most likely the device you
selected doesn't contain a WBFS partition.)

The program lists devices /dev/hd* and /dev/sd*, excluding the devices
it thinks are mounted (according to /proc/mounts). You may choose do
list the mounted devices as well by de-selecting the menu "Tools ->
Ignore mounted devices".

The left pane shows information about the loaded WBFS partition (the
list of discs and the space usage). The right pane shows your
filesystem (so you can select ISO files to add).

The available operations are:

  - To add an ISO file, go to the directory that contains the ISO and
    select file and click "Add ISO" (or simply double-click the file).

  - To extract a disc from the WBFS to an ISO file, select it and click
    "Extract ISO". The ISO file will be written to the directory selected
    in the right panel.

  - To remove a disc from the WBFS, select it and click "Remove Disc".

  - To format a WBFS partition, select the device and click the menu
    "Tools -> Initialize WBFS partition".
